## Inspiration:
My cat Koa, a beast of burden, was the entire inspiration for this project. She chases household items that she thinks are buggies! However, we both really wanted to make a 2d game that we could consider a complete work, and this was the most fun and adorable thing we could think of.
## What it does:
It's a retro style, infinitely side-scrolling platformer! Though it's primary purpose is to provide you with entertainment, I find that it also invokes heavy feelings of *cuteness* as well. 
## How we built it:
We built it with Unity, with **all** assets in the game being created solely by Rachel. She's a fantastically skilled artist and enjoys pixel art (which I was happy to hear, as it's one of my favorite themes). I worked quickly in Unity to bring her illustrations to life, and I'm happy to say we implemented almost every feature we initially thought of for the game!
## Challenges we ran into:
Implementing everything in the allotted time period was our largest challenge. It was certainly a lot of drawing for Rachel, and for me it was a lot of code and hard work to get random generation and all of the core game loop working. This is one of the only experiences I've had being the sole programmer on a project, and though it was a lot of work, it was quite freeing and I enjoyed it a lot.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
This game looks amazing and feels smooth to play, which is a great accomplishment with only 2 group members! We love the feel and vibe of the game and were really passionate about it since we both adore my cat Koa and wanted to do her justice! I think we really did!
## What we learned:
I learned a lot about pixel art and Unity 2D game making! I think if anything, I confirmed for myself the power of Unity and how truly doable it is to implement a fully-featured game in a weekend.
## What's next for Get The Buggies:
Though I might personally clean up some elements, as we didn't get much time to playtest the game, I think we're both happy where it's at. :)
